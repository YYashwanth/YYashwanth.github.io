We often come across situations where we would like an EC2 instance up and running with certain softwares like Datadog, Sophos etc., installed and pre-configured. There might be other <b>sequence</b> of events that we would like to carry out during the launch of an instance. We can run the installation/configuration commands in the required sequence through cloudformation but there is no way (within cloudformation) to know if the installation actually worked and if the instance is in the required state.

So, in order to create a proper sequence of installations and configurations, my manager and I created separate SSM documents for installing and configuring Datadog, Sophos and other softwares and associated those documents with the instance using <b>SSM Association</b> resource type in Cloudformation. 

<h2> What is SSM Association resource type in Cloudformation? </h2>

This resource creates a link between the document and the EC2 instance, so whenever the SSM document, which is linked to the EC2 instance, is updated, it is run again against that associated instance. 

```yaml
Association:
    Type: AWS::SSM::Association
    DependsOn: WaitHandle
    Properties:
      Name: !Ref SSMDocumentName
      Parameters:
        CallbackHandle:
          - Ref: WaitHandle
        ItemName:
          - Ref: ItemName
      Targets:
        - Key: InstanceIds
          Values: [!Ref EC2InstanceId]
 ```

We used the <b>DependsOn</b> attribute in cloudformation to create of sequence of installations and configurations required to bootstrap the EC2 instance. But there is no way to know if a software installation is complete within the EC2 instance. To solve this, we created a <b>Wait Handle</b> in the cloudformation template and passed that wait handle url as an input to the SSM document via the SSM Association resource type and accessed that wait handle from within the SSM document. 

<h2>What is DependsOn attribute in Cloudformation?</h2>

This attribute helps in creating a sequence of steps if the order of execution is a priority. 

```yaml

SSMSetTimeZone:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      Parameters:
        EC2InstanceId:
          !Ref EC2InstanceId
        ItemName:
          !Ref ItemName
        SSMDocumentName: 'Set-USTimeZone'
      TemplateURL: !FindInMap [ S3URLMap, ssm-create-association, !Ref Environment ]
      
SSMInstallAntiVirus:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    DependsOn: SSMSetTimeZone
    Properties:
      Parameters:
        EC2InstanceId:
          !Ref EC2InstanceId
        ItemName:
          !Ref ItemName
        SSMDocumentName: 'Install-AntiVirus'
      TemplateURL: !FindInMap [ S3URLMap, ssm-create-association, !Ref Environment ]

```

As you can see in the above code, the resource <b>SSMInstallAntiVirus</b> only executes if <b>SSMSetTimeZone</b> resource has been successfully executed.

<h2>What are Wait Conditions in Cloudformation?</h2>

We can make use of Wait Conditions and wait condition handle resources in Cloudformation to pause the creation of the stack and wait for a signal before resuming the stack creation.

```yaml

Resources:
  WaitHandle:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle

  Association:
    Type: AWS::SSM::Association
    DependsOn: WaitHandle
    Properties:
      Name: !Ref SSMDocumentName
      Parameters:
        CallbackHandle:
          - Ref: WaitHandle
        ItemName:
          - Ref: ItemName
      Targets:
        - Key: InstanceIds
          Values: [!Ref EC2InstanceId]

  Callback:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition
    DependsOn: WaitHandle
    Properties:
      Handle:
        Ref: WaitHandle
      Timeout: '1800'

```

As shown in the image, a <b> wait condition handle </b> resource is created and passed as a parameter to the SSM document. And the <b>wait condition</b> resource waits for a signal to be received on the url generated by the wait condition handle.

If you'd like to read more about creating wait conditions, refer <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-waitcondition.html">this documentation by AWS.</a>


After the installation and configuration is done, we used <b>cfn-signal.exe</b> to signal the cloudformation stack using the wait handle URL to mark the success of the installation/configuration.


 ```json
{
  "description": "Installing Datadog",
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "parameters": {
    "CallbackHandle": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "CallBack URI"
    },
    "ItemName": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "Not used"
    }
  },
  "mainSteps": [
    {
      "action": "aws:runPowerShellScript",
      "name": "InstallingDatadog",
      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": [
          "$arguments = @(\"/i c:\\softwares\\DatadogInstallable.msi\",\"/qn\",\"/l*v c:\\programdata\\msi.log\",\"APIKEY=ABC\")",
          "$exitcode = (Start-Process -FilePath C:\\Windows\\System32\\msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList $arguments -Passthru).ExitCode",
          "echo \"The exit code is $exitcode\""
        ]
      }
    },
      {
        "action": "aws:runPowerShellScript",
        "name": "SignalCallBack",
        "inputs": {
          "runCommand": [
            "$CallBack = <CallbackHandle Parameter>",
            "cfn-signal.exe $CallBack"
          ]
        }
      }
  ]
}


 ```

<h2> What is <b> cfn-signal </b> ? </h2>

As part of AWS Cloudformation, we get 4 helper python scripts 
<ul>
    <li>cfn-init</li>
    <li>cfn-signal</li>
    <li>cfn-get-metadata</li>
    <li>cfn-hup</li>
</ul>

These scripts help in the installation and preparation of an instance as required. For more information on the helper scripts, refer <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-helper-scripts-reference.html">this documentation by AWS.</a>

This way, it is easy to coordinate the process of bootstrapping the windows instance along with the entire cloudformation stack creation.

This is one of the many ways to coordinate the creation of a cloudformation stack and bootstrapping an instance. If you think you know a better way, please do let me know at yyellapragada@gmail.com. 

Always happy to learn!
