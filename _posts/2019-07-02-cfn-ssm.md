### This article will walk you through creating SSM documents required for bootstrapping an EC2 instance.

We often come across situations where we would like an EC2 instance up and running with certain softwares like Datadog, Sophos etc., installed and pre-configured. There might be other <b>sequence</b> of events that we would like to carry out during the launch of an instance. We can run the installation/configuration commands in the required sequence through cloudformation but there is no way (within cloudformation) to know if the installation actually worked and if the instance is in the required state.

While reading on various methods to achieve the sequence, I stumbled upon the CloudFormation helper scripts like cfn-signal. 

<h2> What is <b> cfn-signal </b> ? </h2>

As part of AWS Cloudformation, we get 4 helper python scripts 
<ul>
    <li>cfn-init</li>
    <li>cfn-signal</li>
    <li>cfn-get-metadata</li>
    <li>cfn-hup</li>
</ul>

These scripts help in the installation and preparation of an instance as required. For more information on the helper scripts, refer <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-helper-scripts-reference.html">this documentation by AWS.</a>

cfn-signal comes as an executable through which we can signal back to CloudFormation. I started playing around with this and found that we can initiate the cfn-signal through powershell too. As cfn-signal can be invoked through powershell, I tried to execute it from an SSM document and it worked. 

After the installation and configuration of a software is done, I used <b>cfn-signal.exe</b> to signal the cloudformation stack using the wait handle URL to mark the success of the installation/configuration.


 ```json
{
  "description": "Installing Datadog",
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "parameters": {
    "CallbackHandle": {
      "type": "String",
      "description": "CallBack URI"
    }
  },
  "mainSteps": [
    {
      "action": "aws:runPowerShellScript",
      "name": "InstallingDatadog",
      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": [
          "$arguments = @(\"/i c:\\softwares\\DatadogInstallable.msi\",\"/qn\",\"/l*v c:\\programdata\\msi.log\",\"APIKEY=ABC\")",
          "$exitcode = (Start-Process -FilePath C:\\Windows\\System32\\msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList $arguments -Passthru).ExitCode",
          "echo \"The exit code is $exitcode\""
        ]
      }
    },
      {
        "action": "aws:runPowerShellScript",
        "name": "SignalCallBack",
        "inputs": {
          "runCommand": [
            "$CallBack = <CallbackHandle Parameter>",
            "cfn-signal.exe $CallBack"
          ]
        }
      }
  ]
}


 ```

Please note the parameter "<b>CallbackHandle</b>" which is being used to signal back to CloudFormation. I will explain a bit more about this in the next article where we will use the above SSM document in CloudFormation to bootstrap an EC2 Instance.

Now as I've created an SSM document, I had to work on calling the SSM document from within CloudFormation. Please read [part 2](../cfn-sequential) of the article.
