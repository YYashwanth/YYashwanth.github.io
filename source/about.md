I graduated with bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a first class distinction in 2015 from India. I worked for 1 year as a <b>technical pre-sales consultant at TIBCO Softwares</b>. It was really fun working at TIBCO Softwares. My job duties included creating proof-of-concept demos using TIBCO's proprietary softwares for the sales team to address the client's business problems.

After working for a year, in 2016, I moved to Australia to pursue a <b>Masters degree in Information Technology with a major in Software Engineering</b>. I graduated with a high distinction and a grade point average of 3.5. My favorite subjects were Object Oriented Design, Data Communications and Security, Cloud Computing.

After completing my Masters in 2018, I worked for <b>Bulletproof Networks</b> as a <b>Junior Cloud Architect</b> for 4 months before joining <b>Deloitte as a Cloud Consultant</b>. My day to day tasks include <b>automating the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines, research and development of new and efficient procedures to achieve the desired state of architecture, writing python scripts to automate operations</b>.
